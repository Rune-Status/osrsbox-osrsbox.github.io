Hello fellow scaper! Just in-case people were wondering about me, this web site, or the backstory about why I am fasinated about OSRS - Here is the story...

I started playing RuneScape in around 2004. Like most other players I had no idea what I was doing at the time... it was an exciting journey. I quit around 2006, this was around when the Hunter skill was released and I lost interest in the game - mainly due to the direction it was headed in. I never played post-EOC, and only briefly saw the HD update that was released in 2008. I pretty much quit and started playing World of Warcraft, until I gave up video games in 2010-ish as it took up too much of my time and I wanted to focus on postgraduate study.

I was completely video game free until mid-2016 when, out-of-the-blue, I discovered that Old School had been relesed. I was so out-of-the-loop that I only found out about Old School when reading an article on Ars Technica entitled: [From MUD to MMOG: The making of RuneScape](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/the-making-of-runescape/). I then watched the video entitled [RuneScape Historical Timeline 1998 - 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFpvIj5Km10) by MotePlox. I couldn't believe one of my all-time favourite games had been re-released, from a time long ago, when I loved it. I tried to take it easy, but I was hooked... again! 

## What is OSRSBox?

[This website](https://www.osrsbox.com) is a labour of love! After getting back into RuneScape, I found myself writing lots of weird and wacky software, and scraping lots of data. I had been doing this for about a year when I realized I wanted to share some of my projects and knowledge I had gained with the community. A really useful advantage, I always forget how I do things, and this website is a great way for me to look back on my own notes.

OSRSBox is also a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/osrsbox) that hosts a variety of projects with software tools, and data. I have a project, named [osrsbox-db](https://github.com/osrsbox/osrsbox-db) that provides an item database available from a JSON API, as well as a Python package. There are also a variety of other resources and projects... Feel free to have a look at the [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/osrsbox?tab=repositories) I am working on.

There are also some things that OSRSBox is not! I am in no way affiliated with JaGeX. I am not a RuneLite developer (or even contributor), but they have an amazing, flexible Old School client and I love using for different projects. That is why I have so many posts with information about RuneLite.
