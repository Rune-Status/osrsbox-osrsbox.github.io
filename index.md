### Title

Welcome to OSRS Box. My name is PH01L and this is a selection of resources, projects and tools for Old School RuneScape (OSRS). I am an avid OSRS player who is dabbling in a little software and web development in my spare time while AFKing barb fishing and the such. Consider this web site and the projects to be in continual development. Feel free to provide feedback using an social network (twitter, reddit or via GitHub). I am very much open to feedback, bugs, suggestions and criticisms.
