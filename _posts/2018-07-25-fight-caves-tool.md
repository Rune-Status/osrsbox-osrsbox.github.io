I never got a Firecape when I first played RuneScape 2. I quit around 2006 and, like many current veterans, had no idea what I was doing. When I came back to OSRS around 2014, it was my first goal in the game. Even with the release of the Infernal Cape, it is still a goal of many old school players. Recently I was doing some YouTube binging and found an interesting video by Giant Bully, entitled [Fight Caves - Predicting All Spawn Positions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG5hy9bfb_g). The video discussed the spawn locations of mobs in the Fight Caves mini-game, and revealed that they are a set pattern - based on 15 different rotations. Now, even the Old School RuneScape Wikia lists the 15 different [TzHaar Fight Cave Rotations](http://oldschoolrunescape.wikia.com/wiki/TzHaar_Fight_Cave/Rotations) on rotations with maps for each of the rotations.

One part of the video that I found really interesting was the code that Giant Bully linked, by the original founder of the Fight Caves rotation method - FwostyMage. Included in the video description was the original [program written in C](https://pastebin.com/vziVqdtR). Giant Bully also linked to an [online C compiler](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/compile_c_online.php) and where you can run the script online. I immediately did a Fight Caves run, entered in the first 3 waves of mob spawn locations and got back a complete list of where each mob would spawn on each wave. It was amazing! However, it was not exactly easy to read the text. I mean, it wasn't that hard either - but I thought a visual graphical interface would be much nicer. So my idea for a web-based online Fight Caves spawn predictor and mapper was born!
